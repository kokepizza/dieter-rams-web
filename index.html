        <p class="about-txt">Dieter Rams, born on May 20, 1932, is a German industrial designer renowned for his
            association with companies like Braun and Vitsœ, as well as for his role in the functionalist school of
            industrial design. His philosophy of "less, but better" design has had a profound impact on 20th-century
            aesthetics and culture, shaping the practice of design. Rams emphasizes the importance of design being
            considerate of people and their lived reality, stating that indifference towards this is the cardinal sin in
            design. He initially studied architecture and interior decoration at the Wiesbaden School of Art, later
            graduating with honors in 1953. Rams began his professional career with Frankfurt-based architect Otto Apel
            before joining Braun in 1955, where he worked as an architect and interior designer. Rams was influenced by
            figures such as Fritz Eichler and professors from the Ulm School of Design, including Hans Gugelot and Otl
            Aicher, all of whom were associated with Braun.</p>
